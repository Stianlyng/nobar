nobar is a lightweight, minimal X11 workspace manager designed specifically for users who don't feel the need for all the features of a regular topbar. It provides a simple visual indicator for the active workspace on your system. This makes it particularly useful for setups with small monitors, where screen real estate is at a premium.

## Features

- Provides a simple and efficient workspace indicator.
- Configurable color and height of the workspace indicator.
- Supports any number of workspaces.
- Designed with simplicity in mind, making it suitable for systems with small monitors or minimal desktop environments.

## Dependencies

- GCC (to build the program)
- X11 library (libX11)

## Building and Installing

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stianlyng/nobar.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the cloned directory:

    cd nobar
    ```
3. Compile the program with `make`:
    ```bash

## Usage

You can run `nobar` from any location by typing `nobar` in the terminal.

Command line options:
- `-h height` to set the height of the workspace indicator.
